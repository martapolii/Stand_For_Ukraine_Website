        <h3>Sources of Stress Ukrainians Face</h3>
          <blockquote>
            "Imagine the terror that a child faces in a dark basement, watching the faces of their parents praying that the next missile will not hit their building."- <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ukrainians-face-lasting-psychological-wounds-from-russian-invasion1/"><small>ARASH JAVANBAKHT & THE CONVERSATION US</small></a>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Living under the constant threat of violence</b><br> As their cities are being attacked, Ukrainians are facing direct threats to their lives and the lives of their loved ones. Experiencing death and explosions firsthand, along with living in constant fear and uncertainty, causes immediate trauma and distress.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Disrupted Access to Basic Resources</b><br>The damage from missiles and rockets has thoroughly damaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure, destroyed countless homes, and obstructed access to commercial buildings. This has interfered with the public's access to basic services like heating, power, water, healthcare, education, food, supplies, and reliable communication with loved ones. These shortages contribute to feelings of insecurity and stress among Ukrainians. The humanitarian crisis was also exacerbated in the winter by the fact that millions of Ukrainians were forced to live in damaged homes that are no longer equipped to handle freezing temperatures.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Feelings of Injustice and Unfairness</b><br>Many Ukrainians are suffering from agonizing feelings of unfairness and injustice as the invasion unjustifiably threatens their hard-earned freedom and democracy. Their psychological distress is exacerbated by the sense of betrayal and the lack of support from allies. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Uncertainty About the Future</b><br>About 6.5 million Ukrainians have fled their homes in search of safety, while a larger number have been internally displaced. These individuals experience immense stress and anxiety due to the uncertainty of how long the war will last, whether they or their loved ones will survive, whether they will be able to return home, etc. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Experiencing the Grief that Comes with Loss</b><br>As of February 2024, the estimated casualties (wounded and killed) in the Ukrainian army alone were 444,000. This war has resulted in the loss of family, friends, spouses and even beloved pets. Many individuals have experienced the loss of their health, becoming physically disabled, paralyzed, disfigured, etc. Even more have experienced the loss of their home and their life. Dealing with this unbearable grief adds a significant emotional burden. 
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>These stressors draw attention to the enormous difficulties Ukrainians face navigating life in a war-torn nation and emphasize the critical need for support, including mental health services and humanitarian aid.</p>

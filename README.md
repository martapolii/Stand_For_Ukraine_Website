This website was created as my final project for the course GNED137 "A Wellness Approach." We were given the option to use web-building websites, as the focus was on the content and not the website itself. I chose to apply my learning from my COMP213 "Web Interface Design" course to design a website from scratch, using VS Code, HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a visually appealing website that had a responsive design and functioned well on tablets and mobile devices.

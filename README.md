This website was designed from scratch, using VS Code, HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a visually appealing website that had a responsive design and functioned well on tablets and mobile devices. 

The project is a multi-page website aimed at raising awareness about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its impact on Ukrainians. The site provides detailed information on stress, disorders, management techniques, resources, and ways to support those affected by the war.

The website includes:

- Home Page: A striking visual banner that highlights the scale of the refugee crisis caused by the invasion.
- What is Stress?: Information about stress, specifically related to the impact of war.
- Sources of Stress: Details the causes of stress for Ukrainians during the invasion.
- Resulting Disorders: An overview of the psychological disorders that arise from severe stress.
- Management Techniques: Techniques to manage and cope with the stress caused by war.
- Resources: A list of resources for those seeking help or information.
- How Can You Help?: A guide on ways to support Ukrainians during this crisis.
  
Key Features:
- The website is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes using media queries.
- Clean, accessible design with high-contrast colors and easy-to-read text.
- CSS is used extensively for layout, grid navigation, and styling.
- The site is easy to navigate with clear links to different sections for users to learn more about specific topics.

This project demonstrates my ability to create a visually impactful, informative, and user-friendly website using HTML and CSS.
